# Object-based Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm(PSO)

PSO algorithm is a classic and effective evolutionary algorithm, which can be used to search combinational parameters of various problems, such as the parameters optimization of SVM and so on.
 
This is a project implemented traditional PSO and anyone can use it as a util class to implement their more complex ideas or projects.
